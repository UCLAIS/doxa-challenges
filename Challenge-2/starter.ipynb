    "**Background**: Image classification is one of the fundamental tasks in the domain of Computer Vision. It has revolutionized and propelled technological advancements in the most prominent fields, including the automobile industry, healthcare, manufacturing, and more. Hence, for this challenge, our problem would be to predict (or classify) the class of the given image, which comes from the well-known CIFAR-10 dataset. The images in the dataset belongs to 10 different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Our objective is to be able to predict the class that each image belong to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**: The dataset is based on the following [CIFAR-10 dataset](hhttps://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). We have divided the dataset into **'small dataset'** and **'large dataset'**. The small dataset contains 15,000 images, where each class has 1,500 images. Whereas for the large dataset, it contains 50,000 images in total, where each classs has 5,000 images. The partitioned dataset can be accessed via this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11M8y08hEDTmMpVq3tZCU9ajX7Gui_0nN)."
